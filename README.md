## üåü Overview

ACM-workspace is a comprehensive enterprise grade monorepo contains multiple applications organized in a scalable architecture.

### Core Principles

- **Security by Design**: Every component is built with security as a priority
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to grow with traffic
- **Maintainable Codebase**: Clean, documented, and easy to maintain
- **Cloud Native**: Optimized for modern cloud environments

## üìÅ Project Structure

```

```

##  Features

- **Microservices Architecture**
- **DevOps Integration**
- **CI/CD Pipeline Support**
- **Detailed Documentation**
- **Animation System**
- **Modern UI Components**

## üö¶ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <Repo_link>
cd <dir_name>
```

2. **Install pnpm**
pnpm is the package manager used for managing dependencies in this repository. To install pnpm, follow the steps below based on your operating system:

You can install pnpm globally using Homebrew (macOS) or npm (Linux/macOS/Windows) :
```
npm install -g pnpm
```
If you encounter any issues with the installation, refer to the official pnpm documentation.

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pnpm install
```

# Running the Web UI
The project contains a web application built using Next.js. To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Run the Web UI Locally
To start the web application locally, use the following command:

nx serve web
This will start the development server on a local machine and you can access the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000. If port 3000 is already in use, it will automatically use the next available port (e.g., 3001).

2. What Happens in the web Application
The web application is built using Next.js, a React framework, and is designed to be used as the user interface of this project. Any changes made within the web directory will trigger rebuilding the project and potentially redeploying the application to Cloudflare Workers.

# Deployment to Cloudflare Workers
The web application is also deployed to Cloudflare Workers. This deployment happens automatically when changes are made inside the web folder.

1. Deployment Flow
Changes made within the apps/web folder will trigger automated web deployment to Cloudflare Workers. This is managed by OpenNext scripts written with pnpm run build and pnpm run deploy, through CD pipeline using Cloudflare accont ID and API token.
Every time you run the nx serve web command and changes are made, the build will trigger the deployment process to Cloudflare Workers, ensuring the latest version is always live.

## üì¶ Available Scripts

- `pnpm install` - Install all dependencies
- `npx nx dev <app>` - Start development server
- `npx nx build <app>` - Build application
- `npx nx test <app>` - Run tests
- `pnpm lint` - Lint code

## General Nx Commands
Nx provides several commands for managing your monorepo, including tasks like running, building, testing, and linting applications and libraries.

1. nx serve <project>
Starts the development server for a given project (e.g., web).

nx serve web
This will start the development server for the web project, and you can access the application at http://localhost:3000 (or the next available port).

2. nx build <project>
Builds the project and compiles the code.

nx build web
This command will build the web project and output the compiled code to the dist/ folder, which is ready for deployment.

3. nx lint <project>
Runs linting checks on the specified project.

nx lint web
This will check the web project for linting errors, and output any issues found.

4. nx test <project>
Runs unit tests for a given project.

nx test web
This will run the unit tests for the web project and show the results in the terminal.

5. nx affected:build
Builds the affected projects based on the changes made to the workspace.

nx affected:build --base=main --head=HEAD
This will only build projects that were affected by the changes between the main branch and the current branch.

6. nx run-many
Run a target (e.g., build, test, lint) for multiple projects at once.

nx run-many --target=build --projects=web,other-app
This command allows you to run the build target for both the web project and another app in the workspace.

7. nx migrate
Upgrade the Nx workspace and its dependencies to the latest version.

nx migrate latest
This will migrate your workspace to the latest Nx version, making sure everything is up-to-date.

## Troubleshooting
If you run into any issues, here are a few things to check:

Make sure pnpm is installed: Verify that you can run pnpm --version to ensure pnpm is installed globally.
Run Nx with --verbose: If a command isn't working as expected, try adding --verbose to get more detailed error logs.
Clear Nx cache: If things are stuck, try clearing the Nx cache with nx reset and reinstall dependencies.

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please read our contributing guidelines before submitting pull requests.

# Contributing Guidelines
1. Branching Strategy
Start from dev branch: When starting any work, always create your branch from the dev branch. Branch naming convention:

- For new features: feat/featurename
- For bug fixes: fix/whatyouarefixing
- For updating content: update/whereyouareupdating
- For documentation updates: docs/whatyouupdated
- For refactoring code: refactor/whatyourefactored
- For urgent hotfixes: hotfix/urgentfix
2. Pull Request (PR) Workflow
Step 1: Development
After completing task, push changes and create a PR to merge your branch into the dev branch. Provide a clear description of the changes in the PR.

Testing Stage is avoided in this rapid development phase and the code is reviewed while merging to main branch itself.

Step 2: Production
After successful testing, create a PR from the test branch to the main branch. This PR must be approved by the CTO and at least 1 other member. Once approved, the changes will be deployed to production.

3. Commit Message Guidelines
Use the following prefixes for clear and consistent commit messages:

- feat: for new features.
- fix: for bug fixes.
- docs: for documentation updates.
- refactor: for code refactoring.
- style: for formatting and style changes (not affecting code logic).
- test: for adding or updating tests.
- chore: for maintenance tasks.
Example: feat: add user authentication to login page.
4. CI/CD Pipeline Requirements
The CI/CD pipeline must run error-free.

5. Conflict Resolution
If any merge conflicts arise, contributors should immediately contact the [Adnan](https://github.com/Adnan-The-Coder) for resolution.

6. Emergency Procedure
In case of critical hotfixes or urgent issues, [Abid](https://github.com/MohammedAbidNafi) must trigger the emergency procedure.
